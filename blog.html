<!-- Objective -->
<!-- The primary goal of this blog website is to provide a structured and accessible webpage using only HTML. The code effectively organizes content into Home, 
About, and Contact sections, demonstrating the use of semantic elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer>. However, adding more interactive features or 
expanded content would further enhance the site's purpose. -->

<!-- Requirements -->
<!-- The project meets the requirements of a simple HTML-based blog. It includes clear navigation, structured content, and accessible form fields. 
The inclusion of alt text for images and better metadata could improve usability, but overall, it aligns well with the requirement. -->

<!-- Use Cases -->
<!-- The blog effectively presents personal posts, an about section, and a contact form, making it a functional personal blog. Expanding the post structure, 
adding categories, or integrating search functionality would make it even more effective. -->
